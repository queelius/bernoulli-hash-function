# CLAUDE.md — The Bernoulli Hash Function

## Paper

**Title:** The Bernoulli Hash Function: Optimal Bernoulli Sets and Bernoulli Maps

## What This Paper Is About

The Bernoulli Hash Function (BHF) is a hash-based construction that implements **Bernoulli sets** (approximate sets with FPR/FNR) and **Bernoulli maps** (approximate key-value maps). The set is the special case where value bit-length μ=0.

Key results:
- **Generalized acceptance predicate**: threshold test `h(x‖b) mod N ≤ t` generalizes the equality test `h(x‖b) = h₀`. Gives finer FPR granularity and eliminates subset enumeration when FNR > 0.
- **Information-theoretic optimality**: achieves the space lower bound of `−log₂ε + μ` bits per element.
- **Maximum entropy**: the salt is drawn from the distribution that maximizes entropy subject to the space constraint.

## Companion Papers

This paper cites but does not re-derive the Bernoulli set/map ADT definitions:
- `bernoulli_sets/` — Bernoulli set algebra (FPR/FNR model, set operations, error propagation)
- `bernoulli_maps/` — Bernoulli map algebra (approximate key-value maps)
- `bernoulli_data_type/` — Type-theoretic generalization

These live in the parent directory `../` of the original working location.

## Notation

Uses `alex.sty` with options `[fancy,section]`. Key macros:
- `\ASet{S}`, `\PASet{S}`, `\NASet{S}` — approximate / positive-approximate / negative-approximate sets
- `\fprate`, `\fnrate`, `\tprate`, `\tnrate` — error rates
- `\Prob`, `\Expect`, `\Var`, `\Entropy` — probability operators
- `\PDF{p}[X]` — PMF notation (defined in `defs.tex`, not in `alex.sty`)

## History

This paper was consolidated from two earlier drafts:
- `oblivious_set_singular_hash_set/` — the Singular Hash Set (complete, ~19 pages)
- `oblivious_map_singular_hash_map_1_/` — the Singular Hash Map (incomplete)

The "Singular Hash" name was replaced with "Bernoulli Hash" because the generalized threshold predicate is no longer singular (one hash target). The "oblivious" notation was replaced with Bernoulli notation from `alex.sty`.
